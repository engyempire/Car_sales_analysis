### Project Overview

This project analyzes car sales data to uncover insights on sales distribution by various attributes such as car color, region, and month. Using pivot tables, I explored metrics like total sales by color and region, average income of buyers, gender distribution, and overall revenue. This analysis helps to understand the key factors driving car sales in the USA and identifies patterns across different segments.
